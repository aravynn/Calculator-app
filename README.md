Calculator App
-- 

Created by Kevin Jones as an independent practice project
Using Win32 for windows-only deployment. 

-- 

Summary: This simple calculator app is a simple test program to learn the basics 
of creating a Win32 application. This program uses a mixture of C programming as
well as c++.

--

Project includes: This program is designed as a platform for a very simple test 
of the Win32 window development. This project is designed to be very simple, 
with minimal requirements.

-- 

Status and To-Do: This project is incomplete, in terms of a fully functional
application. There are a great deal of bugs in the existing code, and the program
to be brought to full functionality would likely require a proper overhaul to the 
internal logic to make it work as required. 

That being said, this program was designed mostly as a template to understand the 
inner working of Win32, in which the program was very effective. Although it was 
never technically completed as a program, its intended purpose was completed. 

To Do: This program needs an internal overhaul of the logic for the program. Decimal
places have not been added, and some math functions give incorrect answers for 
reasons unknown, likely due to the way the program has been built. However, this is 
unlikely to ever occur, as this projects purpose is complete.
